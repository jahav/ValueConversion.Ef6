            <summary>
            A class for holding and looking up information what type was converted into which type in the expression.

        <member name="P:ValueConversion.Ef6.ConversionConfiguration.IsAllowedForColumn">
            <summary>
            Gets or sets a delegate that determines if a CLR type can be used as an alias of a DB column type.
            This is heavily dependent on EF6, see allowed casts CLR types in <c>ExpressionConverter.GetCastTargetType</c>.
            For primitive types (that is not every type, e.g. ), see EF6 source <c>ClrProviderManifest.TryGetPrimitiveTypeKind</c> for a list of allowed types in EF6 as a column.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This has a preference, if this says it can be materialized, it is put into the mediator type.</remarks>

        <member name="P:ValueConversion.Ef6.ConversionConfiguration.ShouldMediateTargetProperty">
            <summary>
            Gets or sets a delegate that determines if a mediator should contain a propery with same name as the target.

        <member name="P:ValueConversion.Ef6.ConversionConfiguration.MaxRecursion">
            <summary>
            Gets a recursion limit that detects endless cycles, e.g. when looking for a connected graph to translate.
            First level is 0, once level is greater that MaxRecursion, throw.

        <member name="T:ValueConversion.Ef6.MaterializedTypesVisitor">
            <summary>
            A visitor that goes through a query expression and finds all types used in the query.

            <summary>
            Mutable because we add types as new expressions are translated.

        <member name="T:ValueConversion.Ef6.MediatorTypeBuilder">
            <summary>
            A builder that creates new anonymous types based on domain entities.
            The mediator type will have same properties as EF entity, but their type
            will be a primitive type (according to Edm), not domain type (e.g. <c>string</c>
            instead of <c>SerialNumber</c>).

            This finds the graph, all nodes and edges that must be translated.
            It doesn't do the translation, it only finds what must be translated.

            Key is node, represented by type, value are directed graphs edges (name of member and type target).
            Nodes should be translated. Edges can point either to a node or a <see cref="F:ValueConversion.Ef6.TargetTypeGraph._keep"/>.

        <member name="F:ValueConversion.Ef6.TargetTypeGraph._keep">

            Types that shouldn't be translated, e.g. <see cref="T:System.Int32"/>, <see cref="T:System.String"/>.
            <see cref="F:ValueConversion.Ef6.TargetTypeGraph._graph"/> doesn't have nodes for these types, but edges point to them.
